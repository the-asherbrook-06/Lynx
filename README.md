## About Lynx

Lynx is a messaging and management application designed to streamline organizational communication. It provides dedicated spaces for organizations, helping users keep official communication separate from personal conversations. With a clean, minimal, and user-intuitive interface, Lynx ensures that important messages, tasks, and notices remain easy to find and manage.

Lynx focuses on structured communication using channels, priorities, and deadlines—making it well suited for colleges, teams, and organizations of all sizes.

## Why Lynx?

-	Mix personal and organizational conversations
-	Make it difficult to track important announcements
